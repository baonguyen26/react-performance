# React Performance

## Performance issues
- The component was re-rendered unnecessarily
- Component re-render time is too long

## Make a question
- What are memo, useMemo, useCallback?
- Why use them?
- When use them?
- Are you wondering which cases will use React.memo, useMemo and useCallback?
- What is expensive/complex calculation?
- Can we replace memo by useMemo?
- What are differences from useMemo & useCallback?

## Target
- Create Click React App and Product Page
- Apply React.memo, useMemo, useCallback to improve performance
- Use React Profiler measure its rendering performance
- Use Components tab to check re-render
